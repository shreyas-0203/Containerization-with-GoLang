**Containerization with GoLang**


**Objective**:   Reduce Docker image size from 1GB to below 50MB.









1) This repository focuses on the process of optimizing Docker images for a GoLang application.

2) The goal is to significantly reduce the image size from an initial 1GB to under 50MB.

3) This involves techniques such as multi-stage builds, using minimal base images, and fine-tuning the Dockerfile to remove unnecessary files and dependencies.


























**Key Features:**

1) Multi-stage Docker builds to separate build and runtime environments
2) Use of minimal base images to reduce image size
3) Techniques for efficient GoLang application packaging
4) Best practices for optimizing Docker images for production
